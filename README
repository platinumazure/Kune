Been making a number of infrastructure changes on and off. Biggest change is
the implementation of asynchronous resource loading and consumption, especially
for audio tracks. My next major goal is to figure out how to play multiple
tracks at once, in sync with each other, and then to load these asynchronously
as well.

Laid out a lot of (bare-bones) infrastructure for Kune project and track
classes. Obviously all of that needs to be fleshed out at some point :-)
